## The Basics

All students will pick a graph theoretic topic to explore in more detail and present the topic to the class. The oral
presentations are scheduled for the last week of class. (See the Weekly Schedule.) At least several days before the oral presentation, students
will submit a written paper on their topic to all members of the class. Thus, the audience can read about the topic in advance
and the speaker can give a more in-depth, less superficial, talk on the topic.
